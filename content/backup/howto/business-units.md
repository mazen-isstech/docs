Business Units
================
If you need to organize your backups for different parts of your organization, 
you can add _business units_ underneath your organization in Cloutility.

In the figure above, "Business Unit" has been added under the fictive company 
"Your Company AB". 
Adding business units can be done by clicking the Add-button in the top-left 
corner. 
Then you can click on the newly added business unit in the left panel to 
perform operations underneath the unit. 

You may even add business units underneath other business units if you need a deeper hierarchy.

Access Control
----------------
A reason why one would want to declare a hierarchy of business units in 
Cloutility is the ability to limit access for units in the organization. You 
can create new user accounts underneath these units, as well as 
assign new roles. These users may then access consumption units _only_ within 
their respective business units.

Try this out by clicking on Add in the top-left corner to add a new business 
unit. Set a name for the unit, and optionally an organization number and 
timezone. Once it has been added, click on it in the left panel. Thereafter, 
you will be operating in the context of the business unit. Click on the 
cogwheel in the top-right corner, and then on Users. Here you may add new 
user accounts that are limited only to this particular unit.
