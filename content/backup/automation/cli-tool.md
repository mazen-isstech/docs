How to use
-----------

### Step 1: Generate a Client ID

Any meaningful interaction with the Cloutility REST API requires a Client ID. This can be easily generated by: 

1. Logging in to <a href="https://portal.backup.sto2.safedc.net/" target="_blank">Cloutility</a>.
2. Go to the settings page (the cogwheel in the top-right corner).
3. Click on API access.
4. Add your client by specifying a name (e.g. "cloutility-api-client") and an origin URL.
5. You will have a new entry in the list. Make note of the new client ID, you will need it when configuring the tool.

### Step 2: Download, configure and run the tool

1. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/safespring-community/cloutility-api-client/releases). There are binaries for Linux, Windows and MacOS. On Linux and MacOS, placing the binary in `/usr/local/bin/` makes the tool globally accessible.
   ```shell
   sudo mv cloutility-api-client /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/cloutility-api-client
   ```
2. Create a file called `cloutility-api-client.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    url: "https://portal-api.backup.sto2.safedc.net"
    client_id: "the client ID from the safespring backup portal"
    username: "username"
    password: "password"
    client_name: "cloutility-api-client"
    client_origin: https://www.yourcompany.com
    ```
3. Run the tool while having the same working directory as the configuration file. On Linux or MacOS this may look something like this:
   ```
   user@workstation:/path/to/config$ ls
   cloutility-api-client.yaml
   user@workstation:/path/to/config$ cloutility-api-client
   cloutility-api-client is used for managing resources in
   Safespring BaaS 2.0 using the Cloutility REST API.
   
   Usage:
     cloutility-api-client [command]
   ...
   ```

!!! note
    To use a configuration file that has a non-standard name or is not in the working directory of the tool; you can use the `--config /path/to/config.yaml` flag.

Using the API directly
-----------------------
If this tool is not enough, and you need to access more of Cloutility's functionality, you can have a more complete interface by having your software interact with the Cloutility API directly.

How to use Cloutility's REST API is described in detail [here](rest-api.md).
