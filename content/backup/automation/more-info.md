Setting up dsmc programmatically
-------------------------------------
It may be desirable to automate the installation of the backup-archive client 
(dsmc) on end-user computers. 
These could be employee workstations/laptops, 
servers or other nodes with important data. 
Performing the installations automatically may be especially desirable 
when such devices are deployed regularly.

There is an excellent [article](https://blog.sigterm.se/posts/the-joys-of-bootstrapping-ibm-backup-client/) about how to do this. 
It also goes to great lengths explaining how to programmatically configure 
**encrypted backups**.
