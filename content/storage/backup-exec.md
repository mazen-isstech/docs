# Safespring Storage as backend for Veritas Backup Exec

Veritas Backup Exec supports S3 as a cloud drive which can be used to
backup servers to. Since Safespring Storage is S3-compatible it can be
used as S3 backend to Backup Exec.

Safespring Storage does not come as a preset to Backup Exec why some
configuration and changes are needed to get it to work. These instructions
have been tested on Backup Exec 20.

## Setting up a cloud provider

Before we can use the Backup Exec GUI to set up a cloud drive we will have to
configure a provider that works with Safespring storage. This has to be done
with the Backup Exec Command Line-tool.

Once you have started the tool,  type the following to add Safespring as your service provider:

``` tab="Swedish account"
New-BECloudInstance -Name "Safespring" -Provider "rhceph" -ServiceHost "s3.sto1.safedc.net" -SslMode "Full" -HttpsPort 443 -UrlStyle "Path" -Endpoint ""
```

``` tab="Norwegian account"
New-BECloudInstance -Name "Safespring" -Provider "rhceph" -ServiceHost "s3.osl2.safedc.net" -SslMode "Full" -HttpsPort 443 -UrlStyle "Path" -Endpoint ""
```

The command returns a definition of your newly added provider. If you would like
to start over you can use the following command to remove the provider:

```code
Remove-BECloudInstance
input[0]: safespring
input[1]: <hit return>
```

## Replace the cert store that comes with Backup Exec
Backup Exec uses Curl as HTTP-client to communicate to a S3 provider. The
cert-store file that comes with Backup Exec is outdated which make connections
to Safespring Storage impossible. To remedy this one must replace the cert-store
file with the official file from Curls webpage.

Download the file from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

Replace the file `C:\Program Files\Veritas\Backup Exec\cacert.pem` with the downloaded file.

## Configure a cloud drive
Now it is time to configure the cloud drive.

### 1. Name your cloud storage

Go to the Backup Exec GUI and click the Storage-tab. Click "Configure Cloud Storage" and you will be presented
with a dialogue. Name the cloud storage to something (in this case Safespring). Press "Next":

### 6. Choose number of concurrent operations
Here you configure how many concurrent operations that should be allowed to this cloud storage. Depending on you needs (if you know that you will have to run multiple backup jobs simultaneously to the cloud storage set a suitable number here. If you start with 4 you know that you will be able to run 4 concurrent sessions to this specific cloud storage. If you get errors in the reports, you can try and decrease this number for debugging purposes.
