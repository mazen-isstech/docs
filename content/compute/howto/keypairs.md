#Handling SSH key pairs
A key pair is needed to connect to your newly created instance over SSH. OpenStack gives you the option to either generate a key pair in OpenStack or import an already existing key pair.
##Generate with OpenStack
Under `Compute` -> `Access & Security` in the dashboard there is a tab called `Key Pairs`. There are two buttons at the top:

- Create Key Pair
- Import Key Pair

By pressing `Create Key Pair` you will be presented with a dialogue where you can name your key pair. When that is done, you press `Create Key Pair` at the bottom. The browser will start downloading the private part of the key as a PEM-file. You should save this file in a secure place.

If you are using an operating system which runs OpenSSH you will be able to use the pem-file directly with the -i flag to the ssh command. If you are using PuTTY on Windows you will need to convert the pem-file to a format Putty understands. This is done with the PuTTYgen-program (that is installed alongside PuTTY if you are using the installer for PuTTY).

When Puttygen has started go to the menu entry `File` -> `Load private key`. Since files ending with `.pem` is not recognized you pick `All files *.*` in the open dialogue and then open the key you downloaded from the dashboard. You should get a notification that PuTTYgen has imported the key. You are recommended to set a password for the key - otherwise anyone with access to your key file will be able to log in to you instance. Now you press `Save private key` and name file.


## Import already existing key
This is fairly straight forward: If using a system that uses OpenSSH you only copy the public key (of you already existing key) into the text field in the `Import Key Pair` dialogue.

If using PuTTY you start PuTTYgen and copy the public part of the key from the text-field at the top (once you have loaded you key).

##Once the key is installed
If you start PuTTY you now will be able to go to `SSH` -> `Auth` in the session configuration dialogue and use the file picking window under `Private key file for authentication `to point to you converted key.

If you instance is connected to the "public" network (and updated the security groups to allow SSH-traffic) you now should be able to log in to you instance with you key and password that you set in the convert procedure.
