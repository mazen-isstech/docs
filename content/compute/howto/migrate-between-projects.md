## Migrate an instance to another project
In order to migrate an instance from one project to another please perform the following steps:

### 1. Create a snapshot

Create a snapshot of the instance in the source project. Be aware that this takes a long time to complete.

### 2. Create a new volume

Create a new volume with the contents of the snapshot (instead of empty volume) in the source project.

You will be given back a transfer ID and an authorization key. Please write those down somewhere.
